When a new version of an activated plugin is available for download from WordPress.org, you will recieve a notice on all admin pages. No more having to check the plugins page!

== Description ==

If you're like me, you want to make sure to always be running the latest version of all of the plugins that you have installed and activated. The problem though is that you have to keep checking your plugins page to see if any have updates available. Even worse, if you have a ton of plugins uploaded to your blog, that list is rather long.

Enter Global Plugin Update Notice. When a new version of an activated plugin is available for download, you will receive a notice on all admin pages much like you do when a new version of WordPress is available. This saves you time and makes sure your blog is secure and up to date.

== Installation ==

###Upgrading From A Previous Version###

To upgrade from a previous version of this plugin, delete the entire folder and files from the previous version of the plugin and then follow the installation instructions below.

###Installing The Plugin###

Extract all files from the ZIP file, making sure to keep the file structure intact, and then upload the plugin's folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.

This should result in the following file structure:

`- wp-content
    - plugins
        - global-plugin-update-notice
            | global-plugin-update-notice.php
            | readme.txt
            | screenshot-1.png`

Then just visit your admin area and activate the plugin.
